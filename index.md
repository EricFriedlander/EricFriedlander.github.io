## About

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar studying under Professor [Matthias Steinr&uuml;ken](https://voices.uchicago.edu/steinrueckenlab/) in the Department of Ecology and Evolution in the University of Chicago. I received my PhD in Statistics and Operations Research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the direction of Professor [Amarjit Budhiraja](http://abudhiraja.web.unc.edu/). Before that, I studied Mathematics and Statistics at Rice University.

In my research, I aim to use techniques from Applied Probability and Stochastic Processes to provide tractiable methods of analyzing large systems.
