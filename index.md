## About

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar studying under Professor [Matthias Steinr&uuml;cken](https://voices.uchicago.edu/steinrueckenlab/) in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. I received my PhD in Statistics and Operations Research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the direction of Professor [Amarjit Budhiraja](http://abudhiraja.web.unc.edu/). Before that, I studied Mathematics and Statistics at Rice University.

My research is focused on leveraging the mathematical theory of stochastic processes to provide principled and efficient methods of modeling large systems. Currently, my focus is on developing tractable techniques for inferring population genetic parameters from genome-wide sequencing data. In particular, I am interested in developing principled statistical tools capable of detecting the existence of natural selection, as well as where and how that selection is acting from large datasets. I am also interested in developing tractable approximations for the dynamics of large queueing networks commonly found in cloud-storage systems.
